<p>Hello! My name is Daniel Dills (he/him). Most recently I worked in health administration as an Army Civilian at Madigan Army Medical Center in Tacoma. I graduated in 2012 with a degree in health administration from UW and I currently reside with my family in Kent, Washington. I'm currently a student at Code Fellows, where I'm pursuing a career as a software developer.</p>
